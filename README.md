# Real-Time Streaming Pipeline with Kafka & Kinesis

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time streaming data pipeline** designed to ingest, process, and analyze **10M+ daily cryptocurrency transactions** for the purposes of **fraud detection** and **trading simulations**. The system leverages both **Apache Kafka** and **Amazon Kinesis** for high-throughput event ingestion, storing processed data into an **AWS S3 data lake** and modeling an optimized **time-series schema in Amazon Redshift** to support **low-latency ML inference**.

The platform is designed for scalability, fault-tolerance, and extensibility, ensuring robust streaming capabilities for financial transaction analytics.

## Objectives

* Ingest large-scale, high-velocity crypto transaction events in real time.
* Use **Kafka** for on-prem or hybrid ingestion and **Kinesis** for AWS-native ingestion.
* Transform, validate, and enrich streaming data before storage.
* Store raw and curated data in an **S3-based data lake** with partitioning for performance.
* Model optimized time-series schemas in **Redshift** to support fraud detection and predictive modeling.
* Enable low-latency **machine learning inference** for fraud scoring and trade simulations.
* Provide monitoring, alerting, and auditing mechanisms.

## Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**

   * **Kafka Producers** publish cryptocurrency transactions from trading platforms, wallets, and exchanges.
   * **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** ingest real-time data directly into AWS.

2. **Stream Processing Layer**

   * **AWS Lambda** and **Apache Spark (via EMR/Kinesis Data Analytics)** perform transformations: cleaning, deduplication, validation, and enrichment (e.g., adding geolocation or wallet metadata).
   * **Great Expectations** integration ensures data quality validation.

3. **Storage Layer**

   * **Raw Zone:** Immutable event data stored in S3.
   * **Processed Zone:** Partitioned and optimized parquet files stored in S3.
   * **Analytics Zone:** Redshift time-series tables designed for query performance.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**

   * Fraud detection ML models hosted on **SageMaker** consume Redshift time-series features.
   * Predictions are fed back into Redshift and S3 for continuous monitoring.

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**

   * **CloudWatch** tracks ingestion lag, throughput, and error rates.
   * **SNS Alerts** notify of abnormal ingestion patterns or fraud spikes.

---

## Features

* **Scalability:** Handles 10M+ events per day with auto-scaling Kafka partitions and Kinesis shards.
* **Fault-tolerance:** Exactly-once delivery guarantees with idempotent producers and checkpointing.
* **Data Quality:** Schema enforcement and anomaly detection with Great Expectations.
* **Analytics-ready:** Optimized Redshift schema for sub-second query response.
* **Extensibility:** Easy integration with BI tools (Tableau, Looker) and ML frameworks.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Streaming:** Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose
* **Processing:** AWS Lambda, Apache Spark (EMR / Kinesis Data Analytics)
* **Storage:** Amazon S3 (Data Lake), Amazon Redshift (Time-series Warehouse)
* **Machine Learning:** AWS SageMaker for fraud detection models
* **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch, SNS Alerts
* **Data Quality:** Great Expectations

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Transaction Event Generated:** A crypto transaction event (trade, withdrawal, deposit) is published to Kafka.
2. **Ingestion to AWS:** Kafka Connect or Kinesis streams push the event into the AWS ecosystem.
3. **Transformation:** Lambda or Spark enriches data with metadata, validates schema, and applies deduplication.
4. **Storage:** Data is written to S3 in raw and transformed formats, then loaded into Redshift for analytics.
5. **ML Scoring:** SageMaker model scores incoming transactions for fraud likelihood in near real time.
6. **Alerts:** If a fraud threshold is breached, CloudWatch triggers an SNS alert.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* AWS Account with S3, Redshift, Kinesis, Lambda, and SageMaker access
* Python 3.8+
* Apache Kafka cluster (local or managed)

### Setup Instructions

1. Start a local Kafka cluster or connect to a managed Kafka service.
2. Deploy `kafka_producer.py` to generate synthetic crypto transaction events.
3. Configure Kinesis Streams and connect ingestion via `kinesis_ingestion_lambda.py`.
4. Set up an S3 bucket for raw and processed zones.
5. Deploy Redshift schema using `redshift_schema.sql`.
6. Configure Great Expectations for validating data flows.
7. Train and deploy fraud detection models with SageMaker.

## Use Cases

* **Fraud Detection:** Flag suspicious transactions in near real time.
* **Trading Simulations:** Replay historical crypto transactions to stress-test models.
* **Behavior Analytics:** Understand wallet behaviors, trading volumes, and network anomalies.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate with **Apache Flink** for complex event processing.
* Expand to **multi-cloud ingestion** using GCP Pub/Sub or Azure Event Hubs.
* Build real-time **graph-based fraud detection models** (Neo4j + Spark GraphX).
* Extend dashboarding with anomaly visualization in Looker.
